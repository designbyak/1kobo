			<div class="modal-body">
			<p class="m-b-10">One can only send you a private anonymous message when he or she has your username. We recommend you to share your unique profile link with everyone who you love and care about. Not only them but you can also share the dare with everyone in your WhatsApp contact list and ask them to answer the dare. By doing this you will be able to know how people think about you in general. Ask your friends to join the platform and send their unique links too so that you can compliment them anonymously.</p>
			<p class="m-b-10">Does not really matter if you are shy to compliment someone or an introvert in general, you can always use the power of anonymity in front of everyone else in our platform and use it to send and receive anonymous compliments, and texts. If your crush is on our platform too, you may ask her out for a date anonymously. Or rather you can do that directly.. haha.</p>
			<p class="m-b-10">Now, as you have got a fair enough idea about what <b>1kobo</b> is, it is time to create your account and share this with your friends so that you can start to receive anonymous compliments and wishes from your well-wishers, lover, friends, and family members.</p>
			<p class="m-b-10">Moreover, The platform is safer than ever. We are continously working on the user experience to make the game more fun.</p>
